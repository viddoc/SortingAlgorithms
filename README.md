Tommy Hudson Sorting Algorithms

This is a program I made to explore different sorting algorithms to become more familiar with them.

Currently it is only set up for unsigned integers but I may change that in the future.
It will give the number of comparisons and swaps for most algorithms as well as the runtime in nanoseconds.

Running the tester allows the user to specify the size of the array to be sorted and the upper bound of the array.
The user can view the array, modify the array to use a sorted array, or change the size and bound in the array menu.
The user can choose the algorithm to use from the algorithm menu and display the sorted array if they want to.
